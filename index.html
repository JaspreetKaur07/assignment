            <h2>The History of KitKat</h2>
            <p>The KitKat brand’s origins can be traced back to 1911 when Rowntree’s, a confectionery company based in York, England, trademarked the terms Kit Cat and Kit Kat. The name was inspired by the Kit-Cat Club, an 18th-century English club, and was first used for a brand of boxed chocolates in the 1920s. The iconic four-finger bar, known today as KitKat, was launched in 1935 as Rowntree’s Chocolate Crisp and was renamed KitKat Chocolate Crisp two years later. After World War II, the name was shortened to just KitKat.</p>
